**CS-370**

This project implemented a reinforcement learning solution (specifically, deep Q-learning) to solve a treasure maze game. The intelligent agent learns to navigate the maze, find the treasure, and avoid obstacles.

**My Work**

* **Core Implementation:**
    *  Developed the Q-learning algorithm within the `qtrain` function.
    *  Managed the agent's state representation, decision-making (exploration vs. exploitation), and Q-value updates.
    *  Integrated and trained the neural network model.
* **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Experimented with parameters such as exploration rate, experience replay memory size, and training data size to improve the agent's performance.
* **Success Evaluation:**  Defined win conditions and completion criteria to track the agent's progress.

**Understanding Computer Science**

* **Computer Scientists' Role:**  Computer scientists design algorithms, build systems, and drive technological innovation to solve real-world problems across various sectors.
* **Importance:** Computer science is the backbone of the digital world, influencing how we interact, work, and learn.
* **The Problem-Solving Process**
    * **Decomposition:**  Break down complex challenges into smaller ones.
    * **Abstraction:** Focus on the big picture while managing details.
    * **Algorithmic Thinking:** Design precise instructions for problem-solving.
    * **Iterative Development:**  Continuously test, evaluate, and refine solutions.
* **Ethics in AI**
    * **User Well-being:**  Prioritize safety, fairness, and the avoidance of bias.
    * **Transparency and Accountability:**  Be clear about how AI is used and align it with organizational values to foster trust.
