## Project Reflections and Insights

### How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
- Writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs involves clear structuring, thorough documentation, and modular design. The CRUD Python module from Project One is a prime example, offering seamless integration with Project Two's dashboard due to its reusable and adaptable nature. This modular approach enhances efficiency and facilitates future modifications.

### What were the advantages of working in this way?
- The modular design of the CRUD module provided a scalable and efficient way to interact with databases, ensuring ease of updates and maintenance. This approach significantly reduces development time and increases code reliability.

### How could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
- The CRUD module can be adapted for various applications requiring database interactions, making it a versatile tool for future projects that involve data management and retrieval.

### How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?
- Approaching a problem involves systematic analysis, understanding client requirements, and iterative development. The project for Grazioso Salvare was approached with a focus on practical application and integration of technologies, differing from previous assignments in its real-world applicability.

### What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
- Future database projects would benefit from systematic requirement analysis, modular design, and iterative testing to ensure tailored and scalable solutions.

### What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?
- Computer scientists develop innovative solutions that drive efficiency and advancement across various industries. The dashboard project for Grazioso Salvare exemplifies how computer science can enable companies to analyze data effectively, aiding in informed decision-making and operational efficiency.
