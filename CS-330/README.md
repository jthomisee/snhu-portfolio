# CS-330 Reflections and Learnings

## Designing Software

- **Approach to Designing Software**: When I approach designing software, I always prioritize understanding the end goal and the user experience. I believe in the principle that software should serve the user and not the other way around. Beginning with wireframes, mock-ups, and a clear specification ensures a solid foundation.

- **New Design Skills**: This OpenGL project honed my spatial visualization skills. I learned the importance of lighting, texture, and perspective in creating visually compelling 3D scenes. More than just code, it was about creating a visual experience.

- **Design Process**: For this project, I started with a clear blueprint of the 3D scene I intended to create, noting down the objects, their relationships, and interactions. I considered user interactions, camera angles, and movement, ensuring a dynamic experience.

- **Applying Design Tactics in Future**: The emphasis on visual aesthetics and user experience in this project has taught me to focus on the finer nuances in any future design endeavor. Whether it's UI/UX design or game development, understanding the user's perspective and the visual appeal will always be paramount.

## Developing Programs

- **Approach to Developing Programs**: I firmly believe in iterative development. Start small, get it working, and then build on top. This allows for regular testing, ensuring that issues are caught early, and the foundation is strong.

- **New Development Strategies**: In crafting the 3D scene, I delved deep into shaders, matrix transformations, and efficient texture mapping. These strategies were crucial in rendering realistic visuals and ensuring smooth performance.

- **Role of Iteration**: Iteration was a continuous process. Each object addition, lighting change, or texture mapping was followed by testing. This not only helped in early bug detection but also in refining the visual output.

- **Evolution of Development Approach**: As I progressed through the project's milestones, I became more adept at anticipating challenges, especially in relation to rendering and performance. The early stages were more about understanding OpenGL's capabilities, while the latter stages focused on optimization and fine-tuning.

## Role of Computer Science in Reaching My Goals

- **Educational Pathway**: Computational graphics and visualizations have expanded my understanding of computer science beyond just algorithms and data structures. The blend of math, aesthetics, and coding has enriched my educational journey. It's an avenue I am keen on exploring further, perhaps diving deeper into game development or virtual reality.

- **Professional Pathway**: The skills and knowledge gained from this project have opened doors to industries like game development, film production, and even architectural visualization. Understanding how to render realistic scenes programmatically is a skill that has broad applications and can set me apart in the job market.
