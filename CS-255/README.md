**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**

The DriverPass project involves designing a system for a new company founded by Liam. The client, DriverPass, aims to fill a void in the market for training students for their driving tests at their local department of motor vehicles (DMV). The system they want designed should help manage online classes, practice tests, and on-the-road training. It should also handle reservations for driving lessons, provide different user roles and access rights, track user activities, and allow for flexibility in their service packages. The system should be web-based and preferably on the cloud.

**What did you do particularly well?**

I helped gather requirements, clarify various aspects of the project, ask relevant questions, and provide suggestions to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the client's needs. Additionally, I supported the team in creating a project timeline, identifying dependencies, and allocating tasks to team members in a well-organized manner. My ability to communicate effectively and provide detailed information contributed to a clear and well-defined project plan.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

 I did not include all the use cases in my UML use case diagram, I would focus on identifying the missing use cases and incorporating them into the diagram.

To improve the diagram, I would:

 1. Revisit the project requirements and specifications to ensure I have
    a comprehensive understanding of the system's functionality and user
    interactions.
 2. Identify any missing use cases by comparing my current diagram to
    the project requirements. Pay attention to any overlooked user roles
    or functionalities.
 3. Add the missing use cases to the diagram, ensuring they are clearly
    defined and connected to the appropriate actors.
 4. Review the relationships between use cases, including "include,"
    "extend," and "generalization" relationships, to ensure they
    accurately represent the system's functionality and the interactions
    between use cases.
 5. Verify that the revised use case diagram is consistent with the
    project requirements and provides a complete representation of the
    system's functionality.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

I would interpret user needs by gathering and analyzing requirements through interviews or discussions with users. I would prioritize these needs and create use cases to address them in the system design. It's crucial to consider user needs because it ensures the final product is user-friendly, efficient, and successful in fulfilling its purpose, while also preventing costly redesigns later in development.

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**

To design software, I would follow these steps: gather and analyze requirements, prioritize user needs, choose a suitable design methodology, create user personas and use case diagrams, develop wireframes or prototypes, iterate based on feedback, and implement and test the design. These strategies ensure a systematic, user-centric approach, resulting in a product that effectively addresses user needs and expectations.
