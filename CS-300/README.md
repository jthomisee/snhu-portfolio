## Project Reflections

### What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The problem that I set out to solve in these projects revolved around identifying an optimal data structure for a system designed to manage course information. The requirements were the effective search, insertion, deletion and printing of a course list in an alphanumerical order. To cater to these requirements, a data structure that offered the right balance between efficiency and maintaining course order was needed.

### How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

A sound understanding of data structures is a key element in crafting efficient solutions in programming. Each data structure has its unique strengths and limitations and is more suited to certain tasks than others. I approached this problem by exploring different data structures - hash tables, vectors, and binary search trees, weighing the pros and cons of each. I carefully considered factors like the speed of search operations, ease of implementation, the capacity to maintain order, and the efficiency of traversal operations.

### How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

As is often the case with programming projects, unexpected hurdles did present themselves. The intricacy of implementing a binary search tree, which I eventually selected as the optimal data structure, was particularly challenging. I tackled this by diving deep into the technical documentation and online resources to bolster my understanding of binary search trees. This self-driven approach to problem-solving enabled me to successfully navigate the hurdles and implement the data structure effectively.

### How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

This project has instilled in me the importance of careful planning and decision-making in the initial stages of software design. The choice of the right data structure can significantly influence the overall performance and efficiency of the code. This experience taught me that investing time in understanding the problem thoroughly, researching possible solutions and assessing the benefits and drawbacks of each, is a crucial part of the software development process.

### How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

The project has transformed my perspective on writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable code. I've realized the importance of crafting well-structured, clear and concise code that is not just functional, but also easily understandable by others. Moreover, with the ever-evolving nature of the tech industry, the importance of writing adaptable code cannot be overstated. This project drove home the fact that proper documentation, both in the code and in the README, is key for maintaining a project that might require updates or modifications in the future.
