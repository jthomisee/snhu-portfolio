# Summary of Draw It or Lose It Game Design Project

## Gaming Room Client and Software Requirements

- The Gaming Room was the client for the project.
- They wanted a web-based version of the game "Draw It or Lose It".
- The software needed to allow for one or more teams, each with multiple players, and unique game and team names.
- The game engine needed to handle multiple teams and players, track the progress of each round, and handle the logic for allowing remaining teams to offer guesses after time expires.
- The application needed to have a rendering system to display stock drawings as clues to the players and a system for generating unique identifiers for each instance of a game, team, or player.

## Strengths of the Documentation

- The document provides a clear overview of the problem and proposed solution.
- The document thoroughly describes the design constraints that must be considered.
- The document includes a domain model that describes the relationship between classes and OOP principles used in the design.

## Helpful Aspects of Design Document Process

- The design document helps to organize ideas and ensure that all requirements are considered before implementation.
- The process of documenting the design can reveal potential issues and areas for improvement before implementation.
- The design document serves as a reference for future development and maintenance.

## Area for Improvement

- One area that could be improved is providing more detailed information about the hardware requirements needed to support the software.

## User Needs and Software Design

- The user's needs were interpreted by carefully reviewing the requirements and constraints provided by the client.
- Implementing the user's needs is critical to ensure that the software meets the client's expectations and is usable by the intended audience.

## Approach to Software Design

- The software design process involved identifying requirements, constraints, and potential issues, followed by creating a domain model and proposing a solution that met all requirements.
- Strategies used included OOP principles, considering scalability, security, reliability, latency, and compatibility, and using technologies and techniques such as load balancers, caching, encryption, replication, failover, CDNs, responsive design, and cross-browser and cross-device testing. 
- In the future, techniques such as user stories, wireframing, and prototyping could be used to further analyze user needs and create a more detailed software design.
